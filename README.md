## About the Video Course
If you want to write clean and easy to maintain code or you do not know what SASS is, then you are in the right place. After this course you will write your CSS faster - your code will be clean and easy to maintain.

SASS allows you to reduce the time needed for creating and maintaining a CSS code, quickly create clean responsive web design, divide your project into logical modules without losing website loading speed, have many logical files in development and generate automatically one compressed CSS file, create variables (you can save and reuse values that are used in many places), create mixins (write reusable code only once), do nesting (which makes your code easier to organize), choose colors for website on a whole new level, and much more. SASS is very similar to CSS so you do not need to worry about learning it from scratch. SASS is expanding CSS by additional cool features that you will get to know during my course.
